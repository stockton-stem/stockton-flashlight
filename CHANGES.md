Revision History
================

Revision 3.2
------------

* License the project with the CERN OHL.
* Include the CERN OHL notice in the silk screen of the boards.
* Include build documentation.


Revision 3.1
------------

* Make the button fingers slightly longer; annotate them in the silk screen.
* Extend the thermal pad under the LED past the body of the LED to make it a
  little easier to hand solder.
* Connect the 3rd button solder pad to the middle for greater switch options.
* Stockton logo in the solder mask.
* Curve the right-hand end of the LED thermal trace; expose some of the trace
  for better dissipation.


Revision 3.0
------------

* Change current limiter to a 350ma current regulator.
* Move current regulator close the edge of the board.
* Change primary labelling from silk screen to solder mask.


Revision 2.0
------------

* Change shape of boards from a complete circle to a circle with the
  top and bottom truncated. This improves contact between boards and the
  copper tape at the edges and also makes the board cheaper to produce.


Revision 1.0
------------

* Initial release
